                <p>
                    I am intrested in web developing with current knowledge of HTML and CSS. My course offers less to my perspective
                    hence I opted for more courses, majorly online. For my beginning, I dwelt much in <a href="">Sololearn</a> courses and 
                    took my learning further to <a href="">Codecamp</a> and <a href="">Scrimba</a>. In these online sites, I 
                    have had chance to meet intermediate programmers plus learn current trends in web design. I am taking my learning to the next level
                    by beginning <em><b>Javascript</b></em> and completing the course. I aim to complete it in three months time and pick on <em><b>React</b></em> as my wish 
                    framework. I wish to partner with any focused programmer for projects.
